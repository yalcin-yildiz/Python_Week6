"""+Create a class named Triangle and Rectangle.

+Create a subclass named Square inherited from Rectangle.

+Create a subclass named Cube inherited from Square.

Create a subclass named Pyramid multiple inherited both from Triangle and Square.

Two dimensional classes (Triangle, Rectangle and Square) should have:

its dimensions as attributes.(can be inherited from a superclass)
methods which calculate its area and perimeter separately.

Three dimensional classes (Cube and Pyramid) should have:
its dimensions as attributes which are inherited from a superclass
its extra dimensions if there is. (hint: maybe for Pyramid)
methods which calculate its volume and surface area separately. (surface area is optional, you may not do this)"""
